## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Java 11+** for backend development
- **Node.js** and **npm** for frontend development
- **MySQL** for database management
- **Docker** (if using containerization)
- **Git** for version control

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayram0402/STREAMFLIX.git
   cd streamflix/backend
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL Database**:
   Create a MySQL database and update the connection properties in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/streamflixdb
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=root
   ```

3. **Build the Backend**:
   Run the following command to build the backend using Maven Wrapper:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Swagger API Documentation**:
   After starting the backend, visit `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` for the API documentation and interactive testing.

6. **Optional Docker Setup**:
   To run the backend in a Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t streamflix-backend .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 streamflix-backend
   ```

---

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the React app:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API Endpoints**:
   Update the API URLs in the React app to point to your backend:
   ```javascript
   const apiUrl = "http://localhost:8080/api";  
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Build for Production**:
   To create a production build, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Optional Docker Setup for Frontend**:
   Build and run the frontend using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker build -t streamflix-frontend .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 streamflix-frontend
   ```

---

## Database Setup

- Use **MySQL** as the primary database to store user data, video metadata, and playlists.
- The database schema is automatically managed by Spring Boot through the `@Entity` annotation in the models.

---

## API Endpoints

Here is a brief list of API endpoints available:

- **POST /api/users**: Register a new user
- **POST /api/videos/upload**: Upload a new video
- **GET /api/videos**: Retrieve a list of all videos
- **GET /api/videos/{id}**: Get details of a specific video
- **POST /api/drm/protect**: Apply DRM protection to uploaded content

You can interact with these endpoints directly or use the **Swagger UI** for testing.

---

## Deployment

### AWS S3 Setup

To deploy your video content to **Amazon S3**:

1. Create an S3 bucket from the AWS Management Console.
2. Configure the bucket permissions to allow public access to videos if needed.
3. Update the `application.properties` file with your S3 bucket details:
   ```properties
   aws.s3.bucket.name=Streamflix
   ```

### AWS EC2 Setup

To deploy the application on an **AWS EC2** instance:

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:
   - Go to the **AWS Management Console** and navigate to the **EC2** service.
   - Click on **Launch Instance** and select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your needs (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu).
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for testing).
   - Configure instance details and add storage as needed.

2. **Security Groups**:
   - Create or select a security group that allows inbound traffic on ports **8080** (for backend) and **3000** (for frontend).
   - Ensure SSH (port **22**) is also enabled for remote access.

3. **Connect to the Instance**:
   - Use SSH to connect to your instance:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-public-ip
   ```

4. **Install Required Software**:
   - Install **Java**, **Docker**, and **MySQL** on your EC2 instance. You can use commands like:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel -y
   sudo yum install docker -y
   sudo service docker start
   ```

5. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Clone your repository onto the EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamflix.git
   cd streamflix
   ```
   - Follow the backend setup instructions to build and run the application.

### CI/CD with Jenkins

Set up a **Jenkins** pipeline that automates testing and deployment to the cloud. Configure your Jenkinsfile to pull from the GitHub repository, build the project with Maven, and deploy to AWS. This ensures that your application is always up to date and minimizes downtime during deployments.
